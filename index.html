    <h3>Follow your heart and do what you love</h3>
    <p>I'm Sadik Rahman, currently studying B.Sc at Daffodil Inaternational University. I was never fond of 
        books from my childhood. I could not hold my attention more than a hour in my text books. In my highschool days
        I knew about websites and how to create them. From that time I have never got tired or bored of doing web development.
        I know my heart and it wants me to create some extraordinay websites.
